SQL

======

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. 
It allows users to interact with databases by using operations such as:
- Querying
- Updating
- Inserrting
- Deleting

One of the SQL uses are for flat file databases, these include TXT files and CSV files, the files are mainly text files filled with lines and lines of data for the chosen subject. 

CRUD is an anagram that is commonly used throughout SQL, these key words are:
- CREATE
- READ
- UPDATE
- DElETE

Within SQL there is a sub language known as sqlite3, this is an easy to learn easy to execute language purely inside the vscode terminal.
To access this the command will be $sqlite3 this is allow you access the language. To exit all that is needed is for the user to type .quit.
One last main command is .schema this calls on the actual database showing the user what the name of each header column is.

One of the main commmands for sqlite3 would look like this:
SELECT ______ FROM ______;
This would allow the user to SELECT a column of their choosing FROM the database they have access too. Instead of choosing a single column or multiple by using a comma (SELECT _____, ____ FROM ...;) the user can use the * symbol, this selects all columns from the database.
An add-on to the query above would be COUNT, this will tell you the number of items in the database, an example would be     SELECT COUNT(*) FROM database;.
DISTINCT brings out a table like this:
SELECT DISTINCT head FROM database; - 
+--------+
|  Head  |
+--------+
|  data1 |
|  data2 |
|  data3 |
+--------+
Using COUNT along with DISTINCT will show you the number of each instead of the items in the column.
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT head) FROM database;.

These are some other add ons to most of the queries above.
- WHERE
- LIKE
- ORDER BY
- LIMIT
- GROUP BY
