    - Updating
    - Inserting
    - Deleting
- What Files it mainly looks in
- CRUD Operations
    - Create
    - READ
    - UPDATE
    - DELETE
- Beginning to sqlite3
    - Basic Query structure
- COUNT
- DISTINCT
- Additional CLauses
    - WHERE
    - LIKE
    - ORDER BY
    - LIMIT
    - GROUP BY
    - WHERE
    - AND
