Aggregate Query

===================================

An aggregate query refers to a query that performs some kind of aggregation operation on data, this is typically to calculate a summary of statistics or to gather insights across multiple records. 

Common aggregate operations include:

- COUNT - Counts the number of records or rows.
- SUM - Adds up values in a numeric column.
- AVG - Computes the average value of a numeric column.
- MIN - Finds the minimum value in a column.
- MAX - Finds the maximum value in a column.
- GROUP BY - Groups the data based on one or more columns and then applies an aggregate function to each group.
- HAVING - Filters groups based on a condition, often used with GROUP BY.

Below is an example of what an aggregate query in SQL would look like:

SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary FROM employees GROUP BY department HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;

In the above query we have used the SELECT to choose the column (for this we chose the department), we want to find the average salary (AVG) for each of the departments, FROM is pulling it from the employees table and grouping them (GROUP BY) by the department and finally using HAVING and AVG together to only see the ones with an average salary is less than or equal to 50000.
