Aggregate Query

===================================

An aggregate query refers to a query that performs some kind of aggregation operation on data, this is typically to calculate a summary of statistics or to gather insights across multiple records. 

Common aggregate operations include:

- COUNT - Counts the number of records or rows.
- SUM - Adds up values in a numeric column.
- AVG - Computes the average value of a numeric column.
- MIN - Finds the minimum value in a column.
- MAX - Finds the maximum value in a column.
- GROUP BY - Groups the data based on one or more columns and then applies an aggregate function to each group.
- HAVING - Filters groups based on a condition, often used with GROUP BY.

Below is an example of what an aggregate query in SQL would look like:

SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary FROM employees GROUP BY department HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;
